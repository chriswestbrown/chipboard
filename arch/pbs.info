Directives are special forms of comments beginning with "#PBS"

All PBS directives MUST come before the first line of executable code in your script

Specify shell
  #!/bin/shell


ex: #PBS -l select=N1:ncpus=160:mpiprocs=N2
  N1 = number of nodes requesting
  N2 = number of processes per node
  160 = total number of cores on the node


REQUIRED IN ALL BASH SCRIPT BC ONLY ONE JOB PER NODE
  #PBS -l place=scatter:excl

Estimate on how long it will take (@ designated time, job terminates)
  #PBS -l walltime=HHH:MM:SS


Designated queue name  == use command show_queues to see available queues (background doesn't work against allocated project hours)
  #PBS -q queue_name

Specify project ID -- use command show_usage to see your projects
 #PBS -A Project_ID

Execution Block:
  Environment Setup - set environment variables, load modules, create directories, copying files, initializing data, etc.
  As the last step in this stage, you will generally cd to the directory that you want your script to execute in. Most users use "cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR" to run the batch script from the directory where they typed "qsub" to submit the job.
Compilation:
  You may need to compile your application if you don't already have a pre-compiled executable available.
Launching:
  Your application is launched using the aprun command for CRAY MPICH2 codes and ccmrun for any serial, shared-memory, or non-native MPI codes.
Clean up:
 This usually includes archiving your results and removing temporary files and directories.

Submit job: directives suppleied on command line override directives in script
  qsub NAME_OF_SCRIPT_FILE
  qsub -l walltime=HHH:MM:SS NAME_OF_SCRIPT_FILE (example with directive in command line)

Optional Directives:
  #PBS -j	oe	MergeS stderr and stdout into stdout.
  #PBS -N NAME_OF_JOB
